# Example 01 – Understanding the write() and read() System Calls

## Purpose
This example demonstrates basic input and output using the `write()` and `read()` system calls.

## System Calls / Functions Used
- write()
- read()

## How It Works
The program writes a prompt using `write()`, reads up to 100 bytes from
the keyboard using `read()`, and then echoes the input back to the screen.

## How to Compile and Run
$ gcc main.c -o app
$ ./app
